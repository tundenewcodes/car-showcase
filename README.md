## Introduction
I loved NextJs! So i felt it's a perfect time to build a state-of-the-art modern application that leverages all of the latest and greatest of what Next 13 has to offer, leveraging features such as server-side rendering and the app router. 
 
Some of the functionalities i was able to in this project includes:
- Used Next.js 13 App Router and Server Side Rendering
- Implemented Advanced Search Functionality
- Created Filtering Capabilities
- Optimized Metadata and SEO
- Created custom filter, combobox, and modal elements
- Maintained a well-organized file and folder structure.
- Embraced the principles of writing clean code.
